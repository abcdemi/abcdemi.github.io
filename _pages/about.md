Welcome! I am a researcher working mainly in Stochastic Optimization and its applications to Machine Learning, Randomized and Distributed Optimization Methods, Federated Learning, Graph Theory and Combinatorics. Starting Fall 2022, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Optimization and Machine Learning Lab, [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/), led by Prof. [Peter Richt√°rik](https://richtarik.org/). Previously I worked as a junior researcher at [Lab of Commbinatorial and Geometric Structures](https://combgeo.org/en/) and [Lab of Advanced Combinatorics and Network Applications](https://mipt.ru/english/research/labs/laboratory-of-advanced-combinatorics-and-network-applications), [MIPT](https://mipt.ru/english/). 

I obtained my PhD degree in Discrete Mathematics at [MIPT](https://mipt.ru/education/post-graduate/demidovich-yuriy-aleksandrovich.php?clear_cache=Y) under the supervision of Prof. [Dmitry Shabanov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=InsQNgoAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Andrei Raigorodskii](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fzY42_QAAAAJ&hl=en) in 2021. In 2017, I graduated from Lomonosov Moscow State University under the supervision of professor [Andrei Raigorodskii](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fzY42_QAAAAJ&hl=en). Here you can find my CV, publications, information about my projects and teaching courses.
